Plays groups of videos in order so you don't have to keep track of the current video yourself.

Just put the folder of videos, with the videos alphabtically sorted in the order you want to view them in, in the same folder as the jar file. Then start the jar. The first time you start the program it will ask you which folder you want to start watching. Every subsequent execution will open the next video in the sequence. When the list is completed the next time you open the program it will ask you for the folder you want to view again.
